# Smart File Organizer

A Python script that automatically organizes files in a folder by type — Images, Documents, Videos, Music, and more.

I created this tool to clean up my cluttered desktop. It uses Python’s `os` and `shutil` modules — some of the new things I learned recently.  
What started as a casual test file ended up solving one of my actual daily problems... YAY! 😄
